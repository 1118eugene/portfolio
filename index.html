        <h1>APT 1030 INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMING LANGUAGES</h1>
        <p> An introduction to programming languages is like learning a new way to talk, but instead of talking to people, you're talking to computers. This new language lets you give computers instructions to do things.

            breakdown of what is expected  in an introduction to programming languages:
            
            THE BASICS: Building blocks like variables (think of these as storage boxes for information) and operators (symbols that perform actions like addition or comparison).
            HOW TO WRITE INSTRUCTIONS: Just like sentences in English, you'll learn how to put these building blocks together to create instructions the computer can understand. This is called syntax, and it's like the grammar of programming languages. 
            DIFFERENT TYPES OF LANGUAGES:There are many programming languages, each with its strengths. Some are easier to learn (like Python) and good for beginners, while others are more powerful (like C++) and better for complex tasks.

            <p>Write a program to calculate and display the area of a shape that the user defines via the keyboard. 

                1. The program should prompt the user to choose the shape, and then enter the required variables.
                
                For example, if a user chooses a circle shape, then the program should prompt for the radius. Once the user enter the radius, the program calculates and displays the area. 
                
                2. The program should be implemented in any three programming languages of your choice.
